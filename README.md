## General info

In **computability theory**, a system of data-manipulation rules (such as a computer's instruction set, a programming language, or a cellular automaton) is said to be **Turing-complete** or **computationally universal** if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine. This means that this system is able to recognize or decide other data-manipulation rule sets. Turing completeness is used as a way to express the power of such a data-manipulation rule set. Virtually all programming languages today are Turing-complete. The concept is named after English mathematician and computer scientist *Alan Turing*.
